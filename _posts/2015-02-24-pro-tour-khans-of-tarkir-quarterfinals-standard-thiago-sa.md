Let me test some post editor goodness on FireFox on the iPad. From the first look of things, the experience is very nice. Of course, that might only be due to the fact that I haven't tried sharing any images, just yet. Let's see on the next paragraph what happens when I do.

So far, things look fine. I can see the indicator that images are uploading. While I type this paragraph, the sharing completes and the images appear.

Now let's see what happens when I try to publish the post. When you read this, it means that the post made it to my website...
